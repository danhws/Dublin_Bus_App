# Dublin Bus React-Django App


With Dubin Bus being the biggest provider of transportation around Ireland, bus time prediction is central to the perceived quality of service by its users. Therefore, this project report is focused on both using historical data to create models to improve predictability and secondly outlining how this project has succeeded in allowing the results for the model to be displayed in an accessible and understandable way through the use of a web application. Central to this, this project report also discusses the approach to collaboration, details on system architecture before discussing the testing and results of the project
